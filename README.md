Requirements of the project
🔑
In the previous lessons, we focused on understanding the project’s context and goals. In this lesson, we’ll dive back into the technical aspects and discuss the steps required to successfully complete and submit the project.
To successfully complete this project, we’ve broken it down into 3 manageable steps, each with clear deliverables for you to submit. Don’t worry, we’ll walk you through each step with more detailed guidance in the upcoming lessons, ensuring you’re supported along the way. 

Step 1. Cleaning Data and Creating Aggregated Tables
In this step, you’ll upload the provided datasets to BigQuery, write queries to prepare the data for analysis, and save these queries as .sql file.
Deliverable for this step: A .sql file containing two queries—one for cleaning the data and another for creating a new aggregated table.
 
Step 2. Answering research questions with SQL
Our clients have several questions they'd like us to answer (you'll find the list of questions in the upcoming lessons). We'll use the data uploaded to BigQuery (including the tables created in Step 1) to write queries that will help answer these research questions.
Deliverable for this step: A .sql file containing the queries that address the research questions. Be sure to save the answers separately, as we'll need them for Step 3.
 
Step 3. Creating interactive report in Looker Studio
Our client has requested an interactive report connected to the database. The report should provide insights into the most common diagnoses and diseases among patients, categorized by pet type and breed.
Deliverable for this step: A Looker Studio report link (connected to BigQuery), meeting the client's requirements.
 
🔑
To sum up, to complete the project, you’d need to provide 4 deliverables: 
A .sql file containing two queries ( cleaning and aggregating)
A .sql file containing the queries that address the research questions.

Live presentation, which you will deliver during the final live session. This session will be recorded, and the recording must be included in your final submission.
